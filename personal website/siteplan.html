        <h3>Overview</h2>
        <p>This website is for my app that I will be making in another class. The main function for this website is to provide a sort of customer service
            or frequently asked questions about my app. Another function will be to describe the app and promote other people to download the app. 
        </p>
        <h4>Usage of app</h4>
        <p>The reason why people will come to my website is to seek help. It will be a place where you can either talk to a representative or look for the common
            questions that people have been asking. Of course if your question is not there you are able to email a customer service representative about your
            questions or concerns. Our app will also be taking in any ideas or suggestions given to us by our users.
        </p>
        <h5>Questions about website</h5>
        <p>I hope that when people visity my site they are able to read the description of the app, and answer all the questions and concerns they have. Of
            course I will not be able to cove revery single question about my app on the one website, but I will provide access to the customer service representative
            that will be able to answer any unique questions or concerns. The cite will also have a functioning suggestion submission for my app as it can help
            improve the app. 
        </p>
        <h6>Activities on website</h6>
        <p>I feel like this will be really hard to complete as the app is not complete. The app is so far off in development that it will throw a huge wrench in 
            the making of this site. Without trial periods and testing on the app I will not be able to provide the information that would be required for the app. 
            I never really thought about this until this point because I thought that it would be a lot farther along in the creation process. I feel like the
            neccesary information that should be on the website is the commonly asked questions, and the overview and the purpose for the app.
        </p>
        <h6>Unique Site</h6>
        <p>This information will be exclusive to my site. The site will the only place that you can get this information. That would be the reason why people will
            come to my site instead of going to other ones. While the other ones if the app gets popular enough will have simular information but not all the
            other cites will be about other things about my app.
        </p>
        <h5>Three main topics</h5>
        <p>The 3 main topics that I chose are -Basic information abou the app- -Frequently asked questions page- -contact us- </p>
